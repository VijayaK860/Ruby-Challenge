# Ruby Challenge
This repository contains a Ruby-based exercise that provides an opportunity for
candidates to demonstrate proficiency of basic Ruby and problem solving skills.

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Engineering of a working solution with passing tests,
1. Code quality with specific regard to clarity and maintainability, and
1. Use of best practices both from an engineering and style perspective.

## Setup 
To run the project, you only need `ruby`, `rake` and `minitest`. There are no other gems or dependencies.

Run `rake` to execute the test
Run `bin/console` to test code in the console before adding it to the Challenge class.

## Requirements
Using the `Challenge` class at `lib/challenge.rb`, parse the text file at `data/timestamps.txt` and set the following class properies:
1. `@earliest_date`: The earliest date in the file
1. `@latest_date`: The latest date in the file
1. `@peak_year`: The year that is included the most in the file

## Rules
* You may only make changes to the `Challenge` class.
* Only default and pre-bundled gems may be used.

## Deliverables
After the exercise is complete, please provide a compressed (zip) copy of the
entire solution repository to your Tangoe recruiter.
